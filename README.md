# Mixed CPU Scheduler

This is a web app that provides a comprehensive simulation of CPU Scheduling Algorithms.
It includes the design and development of a new CPU Scheduling Algorithm (the **Best Job First Algorithm**).


### CPU Scheduling Algorithms included:
1.   First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2.   Shortest Job First (SJF)
3.   Priority Scheduling
4.	 Round Robin with a variable Time Quantum
5.	 Best Job First (New)
